This thesis addresses the problem of autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. The goal was to develop and implement an autonomous navigation system for an all-terrain mobile robot made by the author, utilising a LiDAR scanner.

The project involved the development of a 3D LiDAR scanner, an expansion of the mobile platform's capabilities with additional sensors, the creation of low-level controllers for the scanner and mobile platform, the development of hardware drivers in ROS2, and the creation of an autonomous navigation system in ROS2. This system is capable of executing the key aspects of navigation, such as robot localization, environment mapping, path planning and path execution.

As part of the research, detailed tests were conducted on individual modules of the system. Afterwards, the effectiveness of the entire system in the task of autonomous navigation was verified. The test results confirmed the effectiveness of the system, proving its ability to successfully navigate in natural, unstructured environments.
